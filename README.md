# Methods for Machine Learning Model Testing

## Description

### In this script, we use a database from a company that owns a website and analyze customer data, such as time spent on the computer or the website, and, in the end, we analyze whether they click on the advertisement or ignore it.

## Libraries required for development:

* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* scikit-learn (sklearn)

## Script Explanation:

### In this script, we will analyze the data and choose the method that best suits our needs. We test different analysis methods, including Decision Tree, Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Random Forest, and Logistic Regression. Among these, we choose the best one, further develop and enhance the model, and apply it to the test data.

## This is based on coefficients found in the study and exploratory data analysis.
